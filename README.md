A python 3 script that emulated the AWS Ground Station as a Service API.

# Mock AWS Ground Station as a Service (GSaaS) API

To emulate the AWS Ground Station as a Service (GSaaS) API, we'll create a mock server using Python's Flask library. This server will mimic the basic endpoints and functionalities of the Ground Station API, such as:

- Listing satellites
- Listing ground stations
- Scheduling a contact
- Retrieving contact status

This mock API will be useful for testing purposes, though it wonâ€™t interact with real satellites or ground stations. Instead, it will store and return dummy data to simulate the behavior of the actual AWS Ground Station API.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
2. Install Flask-RESTful (for simpler REST API implementation):
   ```bash
   pip install Flask-RESTful
