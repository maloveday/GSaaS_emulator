# GSaaS_emulator

A python 3 script that emulated the AWS Ground Station as a Service API.

## Mock AWS Ground Station as a Service (GSaaS) API

To emulate the AWS Ground Station as a Service (GSaaS) API, we'll create a mock server using Python's Flask library. This server will mimic the basic endpoints and functionalities of the Ground Station API, such as:

- Listing satellites
- Listing ground stations
- Scheduling a contact
- Retrieving contact status

This mock API will be useful for testing purposes, though it wonâ€™t interact with real satellites or ground stations. Instead, it will store and return dummy data to simulate the behavior of the actual AWS Ground Station API.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Flask:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask

2. Install Flask-RESTful (for simpler REST API implementation):

   ```bash
   pip install Flask-RESTful

## Explanation of Endpoints

1. /satellites (GET): Returns a list of available satellites in JSON format.
2. /groundstations (GET): Returns a list of available ground stations in JSON format.
3. /schedulecontact (POST): Accepts a JSON payload with satelliteId, groundStationId, startTime, and endTime to schedule a contact. It validates the IDs, generates a unique contactId, and stores the contact information in memory.
4. /contactstatus/<contact_id> (GET): Retrieves the status of a contact by contactId. It updates the status to "IN_PROGRESS" if the current time is within the contact duration or to "COMPLETED" if the end time has passed.

## Testing the Mock API

1. Start the server by running the script:

   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py

2. Test the endpoints using curl or Postman:

- List satellites: GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/satellites
- List ground stations: GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/groundstations
- Schedule a contact: POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/schedulecontact
- Get contact status: GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/contactstatus/<contact_id>

Note: schedulecontact.json has example data for POST

## Important Notes

- Data Persistence: This mock server uses an in-memory dictionary for simplicity. Restarting the server will clear all data.
- Time-based Status Simulation: The GetContactStatus endpoint updates the contact status based on the current time relative to the scheduled start and end times, simulating real-world contact progression.
- Extendability: You can add more endpoints or improve functionality, such as validation, error handling, and logging, to make this emulation more robust.
